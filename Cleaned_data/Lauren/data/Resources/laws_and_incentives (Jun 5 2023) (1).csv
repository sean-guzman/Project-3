Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit (IRC 30D), now

Additional requirements apply for vehicles placed in service (delivered)
on or after January 1, 2023, and the amount of the credit will depend on
whether the vehicle meets new critical minerals and battery components

Vehicles Placed in Service on or After April 18, 2023
-----------------------------------------------------

For vehicles delivered on or after April 18, 2023, limitations apply
that went into effect January 1, 2023, related to the vehicle's
manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), the buyer's modified
adjusted gross income, and the vehicle's battery capacity. A North
American final assembly requirement applies for vehicles purchased on or
after August 17, 2022. Additional critical mineral and battery component
requirements also apply as of April 18, 2023, which alter how the tax
credit is calculated and may alter the amount of the tax credit
available. These latter requirements came into effect upon the
publication of the Treasury Department's guidance document regarding the
critical mineral and battery component requirements. Vehicles that meet
the critical mineral requirements are eligible for a \$3,750 tax credit,
and vehicles that meet the battery component requirements are eligible
for a \$3,750 tax credit. Vehicles meeting both the critical mineral and
the battery component requirements are eligible for a total tax credit
of \$7,500.

Vans, sport utility vehicles, and pickup trucks must not have an MSRP
above \$80,000, and all other vehicles may not have an MSRP above
\$55,000. The MSRP can be found on the vehicle's window sticker, which
is also known as the ""Monroney label""; the MSRP for this purpose
includes any trim, options, or accessories for the particular vehicle
and excludes the destination fee and dealer-provided options and
accessories.

Additionally, a taxpayer's eligibility for the tax credit may be limited
by thresholds for modified adjusted gross income (modified AGI); only
individuals having a modified AGI below the following thresholds for the
current tax year or the prior tax year are eligible for the tax credit:

-   \$300,000 for joint filers
-   \$225,000 for head-of-household filers
-   \$150,000 for all other filers

To be eligible for the Clean Vehicle Credit, the battery powering the
vehicle must have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). The
amount of the credit depends on whether the vehicle meets certain
critical minerals and battery component requirements.

**Critical Minerals:** To be eligible for the \$3,750 critical minerals
portion of the tax credit, the percentage of the value of the battery's
critical minerals that are extracted or processed in the United States
or a U.S. free-trade agreement partner or recycled in North America,
must meet or exceed the following thresholds:

battery's components that are manufactured or assembled in North America
must meet or exceed the following thresholds:

Further guidance on additional 30D requirements is forthcoming. For more
information, including additional eligibility requirements, see the [IRS
Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle

website.

Vehicles Sold on or After January 1 and Placed-in-Service Before April 18, 2023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning January 1, 2023, the Clean Vehicle Credit (CVC) provisions
removed the manufacturer sales caps for vehicles sold after January 1,
2023, expanded the scope of eligible vehicles to include both EVs and
FCEVs, and required that the battery powering the vehicle has a capacity
of at least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). An available tax credit under
the CVC may be limited by the vehicle's manufacturer suggested retail
price (MSRP) and the buyer's modified adjusted gross income (as
addressed above). The North American final assembly requirement
continues to apply.

For vehicles placed in service before April 18, 2023, the available CVC
tax credit is a base amount of \$2,500 plus, for a vehicle that draws
propulsion energy from a battery with at least 7 kWh of capacity, \$417,
plus an additional \$417 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity in
excess of 5 kWh. The total tax credit available for a vehicle may not
exceed \$7,500.

Vehicles Purchased Between August 17 and December 31, 2022
----------------------------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased and delivered between August 17, 2022, and
December 31, 2022, are eligible for the tax incentive as described below
for vehicles purchased before August 17, 2022, but are limited to
[vehicles with final assembly in North
America](https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxcenter.shtml). Manufacturer
sales caps on vehicles apply. Note that for some manufacturers, the
assembly location may vary because some models are produced in multiple
locations. The assembly location of a particular vehicle should be
confirmed by referring to its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) using
the U.S. Department of Transportation's [VIN
decoder](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vin-decoder) or an information label
affixed to the vehicle.

Vehicles Purchased Before August 17, 2022
-----------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased before August 17, 2022, are eligible for a tax
credit that is available for the purchase of a new qualified EV that
draws propulsion from a battery that has at least five kilowatt-hours
(kWh) of capacity, uses an external source of energy to recharge the
battery, has a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,000 pounds, and
meets specified emission standards. The minimum credit amount is
\$2,500, and the credit may be up to \$7,500 based on each vehicle's
traction battery capacity. The credit will begin to be phased out for
each manufacturer in the second quarter following the calendar quarter
in which a minimum of 200,000 qualified PEVs have been sold by that
manufacturer for use in the United States. This tax credit is also
available for future EV owners with a written binding contract to
purchase a new qualifying electric vehicle before August 16, 2022, but
do not take possession of the vehicle until on or after August 16, 2022.

    tax, the assessed value of the AFV is reduced by 15% from the value
    from the preceding year.

For the purpose of this tax, AFVs include those powered exclusively by
propane, natural gas, electricity, hydrogen, or a blend of hydrogen with
propane or natural gas. For more information, see the ADOT
