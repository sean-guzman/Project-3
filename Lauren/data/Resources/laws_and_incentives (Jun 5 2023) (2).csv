produces a conventionally fueled equivalent, 80% of the
incremental cost is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase of OEM AFVs for which the manufacturer does
not produce a conventionally fueled equivalent, 30% of the

* For the conversion of vehicles to run on an alternative fuel,
80% of the cost of conversion is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase and installation of refueling facilities for
an alternative fuel to be used in vehicles, 50% of the facility
cost is eligible for funding.

:::

Credits for EVs and PHEVs in Category 1 are equal to the actual cost
incurred to purchase or lease the vehicle, multiplied by the battery
capacity, and divided by 100. That amount must be multiplied by a factor
to determine the credit amount, as follows: 1.0 for 2014-2018, 0.75 for
2019, 0.50 for 2020, and 0.25 for 2021.

Annual credit caps exist for each technology type and vehicle weight
class, and for cumulative annual credits. A person who claimed a tax
credit in previous years for the purchase or lease of Model Year 2004
and newer HEV may claim an additional credit for the conversion of the
same vehicle to a PHEV. The purchase of a used vehicle may qualify if
the vehicle was not previously registered in Colorado. Credits may not
be carried forward and a taxpayer will receive a refund for the excess
credit.

Credits for vehicles purchased, leased, or converted during the 2014 tax
year may be determined in one of two different ways. For more
information, see the Department of Revenue\'s [Income 67
FYI](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Income67.pdf)
