# Project 3

With the rise in EVs/hybrid vehicles, we are curious how the infrastructure is adjusting with the market. We are also curious as to how government subsidies play a role in the expansion of EVs/hybrid sales and expansion. We plan to build a visualization showing in real-time the availability of charging stations around the country, as graphs representing the growth over time.

# Built With

- Python with Pandas
- MongoDB
- HTML
- JavaScript
- API Flask
- Chart.js


## Installation

In order to correctly run our code, ensure you download PyMongo to correctly run the Jupyter notebooks. Python file, app.py, powers our our Flask and subsequent website. In order to properly run app.py, it calls another Python file, api_keys.py (not included in repository), which contains user and password credentials to log into our Mongo database to successfully access the data for this website.  As an alternative, this site has been published using GitPages and can be accessed via https://sean-guzman.github.io/Project-3/MongoDBHtml/index.html
